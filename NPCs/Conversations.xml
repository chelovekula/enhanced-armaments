      <Conversation line="Now granted a .50 cal would be amazingly cool and make it more viable, Coilguns are kinda everywhere now and MG turrets are sorta legacy options." speaker="1">

  <Conversation line="Does anyone else find it weird how the Separatists use the G3 and G36? Given both those guns don't even use their standard issue cartridges." speaker="0" allowedjobs="securityofficer" maxintensity="0.3">
    <Conversation line="You sure? The Separatists have been using .308 for some time now and I doubt they're not making it themselves." speaker="1">
      <Conversation line="Eh, I suppose but what about the G36? it's in 5.56x45 yet their standard intermediate cartridge is 5.45x39." speaker="0">
        <Conversation line="My best guess is it's for accuracy reasons, their 5.45 is pretty lackluster for it, you'd also think with it's longer bullet it'd yaw more and do more damage." speaker="0">
          <Conversation line="To be frank in my opinion I think velocity, temporary cavitation and frag are the bigger damagers than the bullet yawing, just my take though." speaker="1">
            <Conversation line="Yawing causes the bullet to increase it's surface area and dump all it's energy into where you need it to be so... I'll not lie that's kind of a mid take." speaker="0">

      <Conversation line="To be honest I don't know why they don't just use 5.56, it'd make logistics for them a hell of a lot easier." speaker="0">
        <Conversation line="It's because the ammo's a lot cheaper to produce, they evidently use less powder and shittier materials so that might be way it's kinda crap." speaker="1">
          <Conversation line="I remember being on duty on another sub and we confiscated some AKs and some ammo for it from one of the engies." speaker="1">
            <Conversation line="Turns out he was an insider and was planning to kill the captain, the ammo would've definitely worked but it was steel cased and the powder pretty lackluster deflag wise." speaker="1">
