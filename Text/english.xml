  <!--Extra Tips-->
  <loadingscreentip>Vanguard Operators are the mainstay of Separatist raiding parties with their heavy armour and highly capable weaponry, be very well prepared in case you meet any.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Infiltrators are the Separatist's answer to covert operations on Europa, primarily used for assassinations, recon or, as their name states, infiltrating Coalition outposts.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Coalition Assault Rifles used across Europa are chambered in 5.56x45 or 6.5x39, whereas the Separatist's Assault Rifles use 5.45x39 and 7.62x39.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Coalition has a wide variety of high quality, precision engineered firearms at their disposal, with production of such weapons significantly increasing as of recent events.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Separatists primarily arm themselves with more primitive, more easily manufacturable firearms which makes them more readily available, but are overall inferior to their more expensive, precision tooled alternatives.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The mask will claim another life today...</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It is common for both the Coalition and Separatists to heavily arm their offensive and defensive forces when attacking and occupying an outpost, with abandoned outposts tending to be the most heavily armed for thwarting counter attacks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It is unclear as to when Preso and Ignis Latex were originally synthesized, however their properties have made them favourable in both chemical weapons and processing.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Preso Latex is a synthesized form of Elastin, created via refining the material with Morbusine and can be used to produce medical equipment and Ignis Latex.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Close Quarters Combat is bloody, desperate and often unfair, making it a hellish ordeal to be thrown into without adequate equipment.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Marksman Rifles, despite their highly situational nature are often used to trigger explosive devices from a distance without wasting any other ammunition, they're also used to reliably kill or incapacitate a person or lightly armoured creatures at arms reach.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Surplus firearms can be found all across Europa, being phased out by advanced bolt sealing techniques and state-of-the-art supercavitating ammo once thought to be impossible to create, having very similar velocity and stability in water as they do on land.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Hexa-Nova is an extremely potent nerve agent that is outright banned by both the Coalition and Separatists as a result of it's destructive capabilites and lingering danger, though that won't stop some people from trying.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Thermonuclear weapons are often seen as suicidal to use given their almost impractically large explosive potential, though with a bit of crew coordination it can end a fight in an instant.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"sorry I bashed your precious baby of a mod" - Sonar the Synth after blaming EHA and several other mods for an issue caused by Neurotrauma</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Don't get too cocky in combat, all it takes is one bad move and whatever advantages you had can be easily nullified.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Pistols are generally considered inadequate for the vast majority of use cases, however can be better than nothing if for whatever reason your primary is unavailable, or just for simply taking out someone or something that has little armour.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Revolvers are chambered in cartridges that pack significantly more punch than pistols tend to chamber, though this does put a lot of demand on the user and requires both hands to be on the firearm to prevent nasty occurences.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Machine Guns are the prime choice for area-denial, dealing with crawler nests or any scenario that features lots of enemies, they are however very expensive to run ammo wise.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Assault Rifles are the go-to for most situations given their general purpose design, however intermediate cartridges may faulter depending on who or what you're engaging.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Submachine Guns are meant to provide an automatic means of dispensing pistol cartridges, being more favoured against multiple targets as a result, their poor capabilites however raise questions as to if SMGs are inadequate outside of basic self defence.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Prototype Weapons are top secret or lost upgrades to existing designs, requiring Authentication keys in a compatible Fabricator in order to make them.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Battle Rifles are arguably the most suited for combat against most human targets as a result of 7.62x51mm's capabilites against unarmoured and armoured targets alike, however weapons that chamber it are very expensive and/or demanding on the shooter.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Ever since the beginning of the Coalition-Separatist arms race, outposts on both sides have heavily invested in civilian self defence measures and security budgets, making them significantly harder to attack.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The CBRN Suit, HAZMAT Suit and Liquidator Suit are capable of protecting against chemical and biological weapons, alongside having significant radiation resistance.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Ignis Latex can be used in the Chemical Refinery to bulk process Magnesium and Flash Powder.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Fractal Ruins can occasionally harbour mysterious, vaguely humanoid holdable firearms, their origin unknown and are highly dangerous to use.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Anti-Materiel Rifles are very niche, but very powerful firearms used predominantly against large creatures, submarines or even heavily armoured combatants, their recoil being extremely demanding for almost any user.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Firearms are dangerous, don't underestimate them even with armour.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>An urban legend spread around Europa regarding a mysterious cursed mask has recently appeared and grown traction.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Fractal Ruins can occasionally harbour mysterious, vaguely humanoid holdable firearms, their origin unknown and are highly dangerous to use.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Ever since the recent arms race against the Coalition and Separatists, firearms and armour systems have become prolific.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Coalition and Separatists are currently underway with a gigantic arms race in the largest ever attempt to overthrow one or the other since the Separatist's inception. It's very likely this race will escalate into all-out war.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"You made a streamer cry" - Elizabeth the Frog, about to cause complete chaos in EHA's comments</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"IF YOU WANT A NORMAL, PROPERLY-WORKING AND BALANCED WEAPONS MOD JUST USE EHA" - CoR's Mod Description during M12's schizo arc</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Durasteel is a Super-Alloy comprised of Titanium and Steel. It is primarily used by the Coalition in their armours and projectiles given it's anti-ballistic and penetrating capabilities respectively.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Depleted Fuel is the prime Armour-Piercing choice for Separatist weapons as engineers will have near exclusive access to the material.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Titanium is very commonly used as Armour-Piercing projectiles thanks to it's hardness and relative abundance on Europa, however Durasteel is used to go against even the most heavily armoured individuals.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Particle Accelerator Cannon is considered a revolutionary or completely insane design to people, utilizing a highly experimental miniaturized particle accelerator to launch Tau Leptons at 1/10th the speed of light.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Oppressor Battle Rifle is considered by many to be the prime choice for offensive engagements on outposts and submarines, however it's ammunition is incredibly expensive price and resource wise.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Caseless Assault Rifles are considered an oddity by most. Despite their accuracy and more capable cartridge than 5.56 or 5.45, the heat retention is easily the most significant turn-off for most potential users.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Much blood has already been spilt since the start of the Arms Race, with much more likely to be within the not too distant future</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Underwater ammunition has taken a quantum leap since the start of the Arms Race, with advanced supercavitating ammunition becoming the norm and having very similar ballistics on both water and land.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Protectorates are the Coalition's foil to the Vanguards, used to heavily defend the Coalition's territory and attack Separatist controlled areas. They are extremely well equipped and are suicide to go against without the best equipment you can get your hands on.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Marauders are Coalition Spec Ops used for sudden attacks or swift counter-attacks, mostly utilizing equipment that allows for effective hit and run tactics.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Humanity has fought with itself for hundreds of thousands of years, in 2462 on Europa it's no different.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It's unclear why firearms from the mid 20th to the early 21st century have been the go-to options for everyone in 2462, given coilgun technology has already been able to be miniaturized into weapons like the harpoon coilgun.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Contorary to some popular beliefs, the Jovian Separatists do not stand behind any communist agenda. This has presumably become popular as a result of them predominantly using Warsaw-Pact firearms from the mid to late 20th century.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Firearms like the Renegade Oppressor Assault Rifle have become highly infamous as the most effective weapons for mutinies and riots due to it's relative simplicity and effective cartridge at close ranges.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Don't underestimate people when in combat, even powerful cartridges might not stop them in their tracks fast enough before they manage to fight back.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Handgun cartridges have very poor armour penetration and perforating capabilities as a result of their low velocities, however tend to deal large amounts of bleeding.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Fighting multiple people at once can be suicide, ensure to have a plan when inside outposts or submarines.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Stun grenades are highly effective at pacifying a large group of people given their short fuse and quick stunning capabilities, remember that when dealing with outposts.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Armour is objectively necessary when in combat, with hard armour vests being commonplace as a result of the proliferation of rifles.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Wrecks can occasionally harbour ruined piles of random equipment that can be salvaged for materials, though if you're lucky, you might hit the motherlode and find weapon cases and crates of ammunition components.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Ah pity, war is not fair..." - Lev Zotkin</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Recklessly charging into an outpost is a recipe for mass casualties as the inhabitants will generally have the upper hand, have a game plan and use a more tactical approach.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Modern combat since the 20th century has been bloody, unforgiving and a battle of luck, in 2462 underneath kilometres of frozen ice it can be all the more harrowing.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Armour is only so effective, with larger and/or AP cartridges remaining a threat to even the heaviest of armours.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Assault Revolver, whilst using quite an unorthodox and questionably practical cartridge, packs an immense punch and is an ideal weapon for a captain wishing for "the biggest of irons".</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>When bullets are flying around it is vital you have something to protect you, wear body armour when you know a fight is likely to occur.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>From the trenches of the 1st World War to the Europan Arms Race of 2462, firearms have been a pivotal means of taking power away from people, for better or worse.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Put that down, it's a prototype!"</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>A rather disturbing urban legend has surfaced about an alien ruin expedition about an impossibly dark mask with eyes that gaze into one's soul, every diver on the mission was reportedly driven mad and committed suicide only 2 days after.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Alien ruins can occasionally harbour valuable, yet dangerous materials, carry a Containment Toolbox in order to take them safely.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Psi-Radiation, short for Psionic Radiation, is a specific spectrum of electromagnetic radiation with a similar frequency to high energy radio waves, why this spectrum of radiation is anomalous has confounded nuclear physicists.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Psi-Radiation causes damage via overstimulating nervous tissues, causing intense electrical impulses throughout the CNS and invariably disrupt nervous tissue, resulting in twitching, mental abnormalities and more.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Psi-Radiation was identified after an event within one of the first discovered Alien Ruins, where several dive team members were promptly driven insane and committed suicide days later, an urban legend from one of the divers has caught on leading to people believing the ruins are cursed.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The slugcat watches you, don't watch back...</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Alien Ruins are a very dangerous place, however the guardians aren't the only thing you should worry about when exploring them.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>A couple of strange and highly hazardous Alien Artefacts have recently been discovered by divers and are a rare sight, with collection requiring extensive protection and safety procedures.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The so called "Semenov" Artefact is a relatively recent discovery, vividly purple in shade and emitting very high levels of Psi-Radiation, making it very hazardous to handle. Divers complain about strange noises when one is nearby.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The "Strahlung" Artefact is a recently discovered artefact, sickly in colour and emitting very high levels of Ionizing Radiation able to cause significant damage. Lots of planning is needed to bring it on board.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"With Enhanced Armaments I could probably do it." - Polarfuchs, not realising that EHA also overrides NPC loadouts</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Next time, use imperial." - Technojunkie on metric measurements of ammunition</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"How fucking powerful do you want it?! Yeah good luck security you can't do shit!" - Miles, during very early development of EHA</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Sahkarov Syndrome is a condition caused by long term, untreated exposure to Psi-Radiation, causing permanent mental disabilities, the severity depending on the prior exposure and time before treatment.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Depleted Uranium railgun shells are excellent at penetrating hulls and damaging the insides, though have little to no explosive potential aside from the spalling they produce.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Nuclear weapons such as the Thermonuclear and Nuclear MIRV railgun shells have gained significant notoriety given their intense power, able to destroy most submarines in a single shot.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Firearm projectiles and Grenade fragmentation do very little to sub hulls and outpost walls.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Coalition Anti-Sub launcher features a HEDP warhead, causing significant damage to walls whilst retaining a powerful Anti-Personnel explosion.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Renegade Anti-Sub launcher is a simple design and favoured by both sides given it's highly modular grenades, from simple Frag and DU anti-wall warheads to Chemical ones.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Some grenades such as the Durasteel Frag and DU Grenade produce Armour Piercing fragmentation, making them excellent choices against armoured defenders.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Thank you for the heads up, at last the war is won." - Klaus the Flammenwerfer, who fought a 'truly valiant' war over 3 2D sprites</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"You disliked my perverted dog******ng therefore you are into perverted dog******ng tr***/f** 101, never change." - Gas, being triggered after being clowned on.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It's not inherently clear as to why the Vanguard and Infiltrators decided to customize their helmets to look like both canids and felines respectively, however the leading theory is it's to reflect the defining traits of each role.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The "Anthrax" Artefact is a recently discovered artefact, emitting a foul miasma and occasionally releasing concentrated pockets of various viruses and bacteria. Needless to say this item is considered a serious Biohazard.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"I want Liv's thick cheeks to sandwich me~" - A mental patient.</loadingscreentip>
